# Tutorials

This repository aims to hold tutorials and sample code about specific concepts and design patterns
that could help developers enhancing their code maintainability.

## Dependency Injection

The [dependencyinjection](dependencyinjection) module present a simple example of injection
using [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) in Java.

Even if the code is using a specific library and language, this example aims
to be technology agnostic to present the concept.

## Nice to add

In the near future, it would be great to add examples on:
- Functional programming and streams
- Threading and processing
- Some more architectural design patterns
